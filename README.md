- **React Native**:
React Native is a popular open-source framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms, saving time and resources. With a rich ecosystem and a strong community, React Native enables the development of high-performance, native-like mobile apps.

- **Expo**:
Expo is a set of tools and services built around React Native that simplifies the development process for mobile applications. It provides a set of libraries and services for tasks like navigation, camera, and push notifications, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than dealing with the complexities of native development.

- **Hygraph**:
Hygraph is a modern and flexible graph database designed for building scalable and efficient applications. It is particularly well-suited for applications that require complex relationships and connections between data. Hygraph's powerful querying capabilities make it a suitable choice for handling the relational aspects of educational content and user interactions within Eduflow.

- **Clerk**:
Clerk is an authentication and user management service that simplifies the implementation of secure user authentication in web applications. It provides features like multi-factor authentication, passwordless login, and user role management. Clerk helps ensure that Eduflow's user data is handled securely and that the authentication process is seamless for users.

- **GraphQL**:
GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that enables clients to request only the data they need. It provides a more efficient and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs. GraphQL's ability to retrieve specific pieces of data in a single request makes it an excellent choice for optimizing data fetching in mobile applications like Eduflow.
